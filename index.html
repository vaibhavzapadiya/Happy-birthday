Business Logic:
The user can add multiple phone numbers.
At least one phone number must be entered, and it must be a valid 10-digit number.
Each phone number should be validated as the user types.
Functional Flow:
The user can click the "Add Phone Number" button to add a new phone number field.
The "Remove" button should remove the corresponding phone number.
Validation should trigger for each phone number when the user tries to submit the form.
