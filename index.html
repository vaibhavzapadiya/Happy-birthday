Use Case: You need to display a list of products. Create a ProductService that fetches the product list and a SearchService to filter products based on the search term.

Business Logic:
Implement a form to search for products by name. Use SearchService to filter products based on user input.
The ProductService will fetch products when the component is loaded, and SearchService will filter them dynamically.
UI:
Product list displayed in a table.
Search bar at the top to filter products by name.
Control IDs:

Search Form:
Search Input: searchProduct
Search Button: searchButton
Product Table:
Product Name: productNameColumn
Product Price: productPriceColumn
