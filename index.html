 Create a signup component that contains fields for Name, Address, and PanNumber, and interpolates these pieces of information into a paragraph.

   Name Input: Control ID -> #name-input
   Address Input: Control ID -> #address-input
   PanNumber Input: Control ID -> #pan-input
   Submit Button: Control ID -> #submit-btn
   Displayed Information Output: Control ID -> #displayed-info -> Default value -> ""

   *The displayed information should be updated after clicking the Submit button, showing the entered values for Name, Address, and PanNumber in the paragraph.

Example: If the user enters "John Doe" for Name, "123 Main St" for Address, and "ABCDE1234F" for PanNumber and clicks Submit, the displayed information should be "Name: John Doe, Address: 123 Main St, PanNumber: ABCDE1234F".
